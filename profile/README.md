We make complex things to make Scala ecosystem better and Scala engineers productive

Our notable projects include 

1. [DIStage](https://github.com/7mind/izumi): Phased Dependency Injection/First Class Modules/Multi-Modal Applications for Scala (with [TypeScript](https://github.com/7mind/izumi-chibi-ts) and [Python](https://github.com/7mind/izumi-chibi-py) ports)
2. [BIO](https://github.com/7mind/izumi): Bifunctor Typeclasses
3. [Logstage](https://github.com/7mind/logstage): effortless Structural Logging for Scala, structure is extracted directly from AST
4. [zio/izumi-reflect](https://github.com/zio/izumi-reflect): static portable compile-time reflection for Scala and a simulator of Scala typer, underlying technology of ZIO Zlayer.
5. [Baboon](https://github.com/7mind/baboon): Data Modeling and Versioning language with strong schema evolution capabilities and automatic evolution derivation
6. [SICK](https://github.com/7mind/sick): deduplicated indexed binary storage for JSON

Also we've multiple contributions into Scala ecosystem, including [async tracing](https://zio.dev/reference/error-management/recovering/catching/#catching-traces) for async IO Monad runtimes which later evolved and influenced various implementations in different libraries.
